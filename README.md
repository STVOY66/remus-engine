Simple ray-casting 3D engine coded in C++ using the <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/"><b>SDL2</b></a> library.<br><br>
The purpose of this project is to experiment with graphics programming and further my knowledge and understanding of game engines and coding in C++.<br><br>
The end result should resemble the Wolfenstein 3D engine.
